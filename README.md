# Algorithm Project 

## Overview 
The **Algorithm Project**  was developed as part of a algorithm course at the university. This project showcases path planning within a maze environment using three distinct algorithms: 
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
 
- **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDS)**
 
- **A\* (Astar)**

## Features 
 
- **Multiple Algorithms:**  Users can select between BFS, IDDS, and A* for pathfinding.
 
- **Interactive Maze Generation:**  Generate mazes with a specified number of walls either randomly or manually.

## Usage 
 
1. **Select Algorithm:**  Upon launching the application, choose the desired pathfinding algorithm from the available options.
  
2. **Generate Maze:**  Create a maze either randomly or manually by placing walls, start, and target points.
 
3. **Run Pathfinding:**  Execute the selected algorithm to visualize the path from the start to the target.
